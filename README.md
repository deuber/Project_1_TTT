#WDI: First Project Tic Tac Toe
*Week 2: Putting all it all together a interactive game.* 
###My first OPP project
*I was first introduced to Object Oriented Programing over 10 years ago when watching a Lynda.com video. You know that simple example...create animal, dog, cat Class, etc..It seemed simple and made sense too. Our assignment this weekend, was to refactor our Tic Tac Toe game using OOP. Simple? Not really. Sure we need to create Board and Game constructors. But it's not so easy to figure which methods or prototypes those CLasses should have. After some time away from the keyboard, I imagined what my OPP TTT should look like. Once sorted out, I created a working OPP version, and along the way learned a great deal about JQuery, Constructors and Prototypes.*  

### Technologies Used
*Integrated Object Oriented Programming design patterns*
*Used jQuery*
*Abide by the separation of concerns principle with different HTML, CSS, & JavaScript files*
*Looks nice, easy to understand, and fun to play. No bugs!*
*KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid)and DRY(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles*

###Existing features
*First to 5 feature*
*ClearBox button for ties*
*Boxes change color to show how user won*
*Resets the boxes after each winner is found*
*Displays how many times each user has won*

###Planned features
*Add a stopwatch to speed up the game if disired by user* 
*Refactor Is winner function, could be more DRY*
*Mobilize it with responsive design*
